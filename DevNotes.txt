This will be imported into the root component and used to creeate your data driven app

*** Working Notes: Consider Changing question.json object to include key: value pairs to make it easier 
to iterate through 

 <!-- :key="`${ key }-${ index }`" -->
    <!-- v-bind:key="index" -->
    <!-- <div class="optionals" v-for="(key, index) in question.options" v-bind:key="index"> -->
    <!-- <input type="radio" :value="index"/> -->
    <!-- {{ key }} -->
    <!-- @change="selectWinner(game.id, game.pollanswers[indexy].id)" -->

     printThis(x) {
      console.log(x);
    },
