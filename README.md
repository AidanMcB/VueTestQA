# vue-test-qa
-This is a Vue Quiz Application that prompts the user to answer 10 multiple choice questions and grades their answer. If the user does not answer every question, they will not be able to submit the quiz until they do. Styling to indicate correct, incorrect, or unfinished answers exists on the question cards. In addition, styling to indicate the missed correct answer exists within the incorrect questions after submission. When the user is finished with the quiz, their score will be calculated and displayed at the top of the page,
and they can reload the quiz to try again. 
-As my time working with Vue.js, I enjoyed the experience to learn a new JavaScript framework. I noticed many similarities to other frameworks, and a few key differences. I enjoy the structure of the components, especially that the styling can be right inside the component file. It feels easier to separate different component stylings.
